# Datasets Produced by snpArcher
A number of resequencing datasets have been run with snpArcher generating consistent variant calls, available via [Globus](https://www.globus.org/) in the [Comparative Population Genomics Data collection](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=d2b75419-85ad-4871-8f34-003d73bbae7d&origin_path=%2F). Details of data processing are described [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.22.546168v1). If you use any of these datasets in your projects, please cite both the snpArcher paper and the original data producers.
