# Control/overwrite resources per rule.
# To use this feature, uncomment "set-resources:" below and add rules you want to customize.
# Examples:
#
# set-resources:
#   # Example 1: Increase memory for bam2gvcf rule
#   bam2gvcf:
#     mem_mb: attempt * 64000  # Customize memory allocation
#     mem_mb_reduced: (attempt * 64000) * 0.9  # Customize Java memory allocation
#
#   # Example 2: Set slurm parameters for a resource-intensive rule
#   sentieon_haplotyper:
#     mem_mb: attempt * 8000
#     mem_mb_reduced: (attempt * 8000) * 0.9
#     slurm_partition: high-mem
#     runtime: "24:00:00"
#     cpus_per_task: 32
#
# To customize a rule, copy one of the example blocks above, paste it under "set-resources:",
# replace the rule name with your target rule, and adjust the resource parameters as needed.
