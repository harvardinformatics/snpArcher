# Interval approach options, only applicable if intervals is True
minNmer: 500 # the minimum Nmer used to split up the genome; e.g. a value of 200 means only Nmers 200 or greater are used to define the boundaries of intervals. The minimum is 50.
num_gvcf_intervals: 3 # The maximum number of intervals to create for GVCF generation. Note: the actual number of intervals may be less than the specified value if the reference genome has very few gaps.
db_scatter_factor: 0.15 # Scatter factor for calculating number of intervals to create for genomics db generation. (scatter_factor * num_samples * num_gvcf_intervals) gives us number of db intervals to create. Reccomend <1

## Coverage options ##
## default pipeline is optimized for low coverage data - if using high coverage data (> 10x), uncomment high coverage options and comment out low coverage options
min_depth: 2
# low coverage options (< 10x)
minP: 1
minD: 1

# high coverage options (> 10x)
#minP: 2
#minD: 4

het_prior: 0.005 #prior probabilty of heterozygous site; changes likelihood of a site being called non-ref, but not genotype likelihoods

## callable sites bed file thresholds ##
########################################

mappability_min: 1 #regions of the genome with mappability less than this will be removed from callable sites bed file
cov_threshold: 2 #regions of the genome with coverage above/below cov_thresh standard deviations will be filtered

#this ignores small regions of abberatant coverage/mappability as often these are just below the threshold
#to do strict filtering, set to 0

callable_merge: 100 #merge callable regions separated by this or fewer bp into a single region
