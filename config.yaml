# if using the BAM -> VCF workflows
bamsForGatk: "fastq2bam/01_mappedReads/" # directory containing BAMs for GATK. If you used the fastq -> bam workflow above, simply keep the default value; must be followed by a "/"
bamsForFB: "fastq2bam/01_mappedReads/"   # directory containing BAMs for Freebayes. If you used the fastq -> bam workflow above, simply keep the default value; must be followed by a "/"
bam_suffix: "_final.bam"                 # the suffix for your BAM files that follow all the sample names. If you use the fastq->BAM workflow above, simply keep the default value 

# These parameters control how the genome gets split into intervals according to Nmers in the reference genome
minNmer: 500                    # the minimum Nmer used to split up the genome; e.g. a value of 200 means only Nmers 200 or greater are used to define the boundaries of intervals. The minimum is 50.
maxIntervalLen: 15000000          # the desired maximum size of an interval for calling variants; more than 2Mb is a good starting point
maxBpPerList: 15000000            # the desired maximum number of bp per list file for GATK4; list files potentially contain many small intervals, and we cap the fraction of the genome contained in each list file here
maxIntervalsPerList: 200        # the desired maximum number of intervals per list file for GATK4; this prevents list files from containing thousands of small intervals, which can slow parts of GATK4. Default is good.

maxDP_fb: 200 # this is the maximum depth parameter used for freebayes, site with more than this number are ignored, change according to expected depth

## Coverage options ##
## default pipeline is optimized for low coverage data - if using high coverage data (> 10x), uncomment high coverage options and comment out low coverage options

# low coverage options (< 10x) 
minP: 1
minD: 1

# high coverage options (> 10x)
#minP: 2
#minD: 4
